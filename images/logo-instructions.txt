HANDYMAN SERVICES LOGO INSTRUCTIONS

To save the handyman logo image:

1. Open the save-logo.html file in this directory in a web browser
2. Right-click on the displayed logo image
3. Select "Save image as..."
4. Save the file as "logo.png" in this directory (handyman-services/images/)

The logo image is already referenced in the website code, so once you save it as logo.png, 
the website will display the proper logo throughout all pages.

Note: The logo should be the handyman character with blue cap and overalls giving a thumbs up
inside a blue circular border.
